Decentralized network for global education partnerships.

Global Education Network
Vision

The Global Education Network aims to revolutionize global education by creating a decentralized platform that facilitates educational partnerships, resource sharing, and verifiable credential issuance. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform seeks to build trust and transparency among educational institutions worldwide, empowering students and institutions alike through a secure and immutable system.
Flowchart

Below is a simplified flowchart of the Global Education Network's operations:

    Network Admin Adds Institutions:
        The network administrator registers institutions on the platform.

    Institution Forms Partnerships:
        Institutions create partnerships with other registered institutions.

    Issuing Credentials:
        Partner institutions issue verifiable credentials to students based on their completed courses.

    Credential Verification:
        Credentials can be verified publicly through the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and integrity.

Plaintext

[ Network Admin ] --> [ Register Institutions ]
                     --> [ Form Partnerships ]
                     --> [ Issue Credentials ]
                     --> [ Verify Credentials ]
